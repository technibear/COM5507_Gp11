# COM5507_Gp11
This repository stores all the original codes for Group 11's final group project on COM 5507 â€“ Social Media Data Acquisition and Processing.
Our project is named The Power of Lyrics: A Study of Taylor Swift.
The research explores the influence of Taylor Swift's lyrics on listener emotions.
We obtained data from Last.fm, Spotify, YouTube, and Genius.
Here, we also show samples of the two datasets ultimately used for data analysis.
